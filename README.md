# Hellfied Vanilla Rebooted

## A hardcore difficulty enhancement datapack for experienced Minecraft players

Hellfied Vanilla Rebooted turns vanilla Minecraft into a relentless survival experience where hesitation is punished and mastery is rewarded.
This is not a simple difficulty tweak—it is a **hardcore evolution of vanilla combat**, built to challenge players who already know the game inside and out.

Enemies are smarter. The world is less forgiving. Every fight matters.

---

## 🎯 Overview

Hellfied Vanilla Rebooted is designed for veteran players who crave danger, tension, and meaningful combat.
By enhancing vanilla enemy AI and mechanics, the datapack creates intense encounters that demand positioning, awareness, and fast decision-making.

The core philosophy is simple:

> **Everything should feel vanilla — until it tries to kill you.**

Nothing is replaced. Everything is pushed further.

## ⚔️ Current Features

### Brutal Vanilla Enhancements

* Terrain and obstacles can no longer be trusted as safe zones
* Enemies relentlessly pursue players instead of giving up easily
* Combat favors skill, preparation, and smart movement
* Encounters are more dynamic, aggressive, and punishing

These changes build directly on existing vanilla systems, ensuring the experience feels authentic—just far more dangerous.

---

## 🔮 Planned Features

Hellfied Vanilla Rebooted is actively expanding beyond enemy behavior.
Future updates aim to deepen both combat and progression.

* **Custom Items**
  Survival-oriented equipment designed to withstand Hellfied-level threats

* **Special Mobs**
  New enemy variants with unique behaviors, attack patterns, and roles

* **Expanded Enemy Enhancements**
  Further improvements across a wider range of vanilla mobs

* **More Challenges Ahead**
  New mechanics intended to test even the most experienced players

The goal is simple: **raise the skill ceiling without breaking vanilla immersion.**
